### **Introduction - the project's aim**
This project is a peer-graded assignment for getting and cleaning data coursera course.
The goal of this project is to prepare tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis.

### **Data source**
the source of this data is [UCI archive](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
which calls for Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

### **Technologies**
this project is created with **R 4.0.3**

### **Project Description**
the project prepares tidy dataset that can be used for downstream analysis in 7 successive steps shown in R.script file and can be summarized as follows: 

1. Download the required files.
2. read the data txt files.
3. Merging the train and the test datasets to create one dataset
4. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Extract only the measurements on the mean
and standard deviation for each measurement
6. label the data set with descriptive variable names
7. From the data set in step 5, create a second,
independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

### **Setup**
To run this project, just run the code included in the R script.R file.
